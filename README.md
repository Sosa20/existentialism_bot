# existentialism_bot

Trained using a RNN following the https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation tutorial
The data was received from wiki quote Jean-Paul Sartre page https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre

Currently the RNN is not working really well. Text does not look like english very much 

Next steps will consist of trying out other approaches (pre-trained models, transformers) and potentially gpt-3
